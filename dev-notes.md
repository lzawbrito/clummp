# Development Notes 
## Proposed features: 
- [ ] Interpolation between simulated frames
- [ ] Rescale simulated data to avoid overhead from Plotly
- [ ] Move submission to sidebar 
- [ ] Allow submission of files
- [ ] Allow custom mounting?
- [ ] File explorer

## General Clarifications 
- [ ] Preprocessing to do on the data
- [ ] From where do we measure the distance between these objects? Some are
	   farther others closer... so?

## Visualization methods: 
- [ ] Flicker 
- [ ] Grayscale vs color 
- [ ] Side-by-side
