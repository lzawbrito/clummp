## Overview
CluMMP (Cluster Merger Matching Program) is a web-based visualization tool for comparative analysis of simulated and observed galaxy cluster merger data. The tool aims to expedite the task of finding the most resembling simulated cluster merger to an input observed merger. 

Due to the complex dynamics and extremely slow evolutions of galaxy cluster mergers, observationally determining the elapsed time of such events is a difficult and uncertain task. This is typically done by comparing observed mergers with simulations from which we can extract such information; however, current approaches to characterizing timelines of cluster mergers from simulated collisions are largely non-systematic or heuristic. In particular, there are no existing parameter space exploration tools for cluster mergers, although there are similar tools for analysis of galaxy mergers.
